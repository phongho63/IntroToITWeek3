	<h1>Personal Information</h1>
		<p>Hello! Welcome you guys to my personal profile website! My name is Ho Buu Quoc Phong, I am currently a Vietnamese student studying Information Technology in RMIT University Vietnam aiming to become a programmer in the near future, my student number is S3803566, my email address is s3803566@rmit.edu.vn. The languages that I know currently are English and Vietnamese. A small fact about me is that I used to study in Canada (Toronto) in York University as a Psychology student before coming back to Vietnam pursuing I.T.</P>

	<h1>Interest in I.T</h1>


		<h2>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h2>
		<p> My biggest motivation is probably because of my older cousin, he is two years older than me but ever since he was a middle schooler he had already knew how to grab my attention whenever I came to visit him, seeing him messing around with bunch of foreign words/lines over and over again never really bored me out. Up until my highschool years when I joined an Advanced Program class that was about Computer Science he would still have his ways to impress me. During that time since it was an advanced course I didn’t get to learn Python but instead I skipped right to Javascript. Though it was a very challenging course, getting to learn about python now made me realize how strict Javascript was, but even when I made multiple simple small errors constantly it did not drain my “fighting spirit” because the feeling of seeing your code finally runs after multiple multiple errors is very rewarding, it is like licking your first lollipop but this time you can simulate that feeling over and over again the more you generate codes.</p>

		<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
		<p>I chose to specifically come to RMIT Vietnam because it is the closest university to home that provides the same education level as other universities in other parts of the world. Knowing that I would have a wider job option studying abroad. RMIT provides a more comfortable environment for me to work in, no matter where you go, home is still the most comfortable place you could ever be. Hence why I decided to study in RMIT Vietnam, where there’s no foreign things for me to be concerned about, I get to meet wonderful people Vietnamese and students from across the globe.</P>

		<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
		<p>During my studies in RMIT, I am expecting to learn different kinds of coding languages, from the simplest to the most complex language that I can lay my hands on. Enhancing my thinking process by encountering multiple diverse challenges and improving my problem-solving skills by dealing with them. Aside from the education goals I would also want to improve on my social skills by participating in group projects and activities, strengthening my confidence to express my ideas, being able to talk to a crowd, body language to just overall being able to socialize better outside school.</p>

	<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

		<p>As for my future job, looking through the list of jobs I think that the jobs that I would be fitting most are software-related, hence why I chose to be an Android Software Engineer for LG. Here is the link directing you to their job description <a href="https://itviec.com/it-jobs/android-software-engineer-up-to-2000-lg-development-center-vietnam-3217?lab_feature=employer_job/"> page</a></p>

		<h2>Set up plan in the future</h2>
		<p>My future plan to help me achieve the ideal job that I picked is first, getting a degree in the requirement courses such as Information Technology, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, etc … From there I should be able to obtain most of the requirements’ experiences such as knowing how to use Java/C++, JIRA, getting more use of Git and control tools. Moving away from the programming-related skills, Mathematics, Mechanics and Informatics are also needed, I am planning to fit one by one onto the suitable programming subjects that I have such as Mechanics with Computer Engineering, though I hope that they are similar to each other from just the subject’s name. All in all that is all the main things that I will be throwing myself into. Other requirements like ability to present to the head management can be developed during my time studying my required courses, presentations can not be avoided so I am quite confident seeing myself having the confidence to speak and creating a well-made presentation with my team.</p>
	
	<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
		<h2>16 Personalities results:</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/703996372029931564/738071835555659836/unknown.png" width="700" height="600">
			<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
			<p>From the 16 personalities results it showed me that I am more of an emotion-driven person, most of the time my actions will reflect back on how I feel about it more than how I think about it, since my intuition is 62% showing that I also sometimes understand things without the present of the conscious reasoning behind it.</p>
			<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
			<p>Personally I tend to listen more and speak less, so if I were to be in a group work I would be taking ideas from the members and give out my idea as the last person after listening to all the members’ contributions, that can be a good thing with one member having a bigger picture but sometimes my decisions would not be as effective since I would be listening to how I feel about it rather than actually analyzing the situation.</p>
			<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
			<p>I think that when forming a group I should be aiming for a group that balances out the introverts and extroverts so when the extrovert members make decisions, we can back up their ideas with our more thorough analysis, on contrary they can also assist us with their creative ideas and the team-working spirit boost.</p>
		<h2>Education Planner results:</h2>

			<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
			<p>The test results shows that in order for me to learn I have to physically take part in doing them to progress, I will have a hard time if it is from hearing through ears or through reading, expressing myself is a challenge for me since I will be using my hand gestures more when I express my ideas and I do not have a specific sitting pose. I do not like to sit or stand still when I am bored and breaking down things before rebuilding them up intrigues me. I really like physical form encouragement such as high-fiving or pat on the back. I have to interact with the problem in order to learn about it.</p>
			<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
			<p>When in a team I will be listening to the team while walking around and taking notes to remind myself about the details that are being put out by my members. When it comes to encouraging I will be giving them pats on the back, fist-bumping to boost up their spirit as mine. I would give a very interactive presentation since my hands would be moving a lot grabbing the viewers’ attention while constantly moving around and not just standing in one spot pointing at the board.</p>
			<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
			<p>When forming a team I will be looking for teammates that excel on their hearing abilities and reading abilities to balance out and assist the other weak traits as to diversify the presentation. Having different learning styles teammates means you can see different kinds of information each member puts out while everyone receives the same resource, different perspective means a more diverse presentation.</p>
		<h2>Test my Creacivity results:</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/703996372029931564/738073586148966461/unknown.png" width="900" height="600">
			<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
			<p>Overall the result shows that my creativity is not that high so as most of the specific traits inside the creativity graph. The only trait that I slightly excel at is Perspective, being able to persuade others, change their perspective of the situation by presenting my own thoughts and thinking process.</p>
			<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
			<p>When I am in a team I will not be making a lot of contributions to the initial ideas to the table as I am lack of creativity, though I will provide in depth details on why I think the idea that I choose is a good idea to build the group project on and help the team make fast, clearer choices.</p>
			<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
			<p>Although persuasion is my trait I still need creative members that give me their unique and fascinating ideas so I can pick and learn from. So my goal when I am making a team is to find those elements so that they can cover my weaknesses as I provide them with my strengthened abilities. I would also want to avoid meeting the people that have the same traits as me because then there will be conflicts that are harder and take more time to resolve.</p>
	
	<h1>Ideal Project:</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>For my future project I will be making a chatterbot that interacts with the user and cheers them up when they’re sad or even be that friend that fully supports them when they have no one to support them ultimately improve or maybe even replace those negative feelings with better ones, the bot will not be an advisor but more of a motivator, filling them with a better perspective of the situation so they feel encouraged and let themselves make changes overall improving their life.</p>
	
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>Living in the 21st century I have noticed that the amount of people in across the world are suffering from depression, there are groups that grow stronger from fighting through depression, but there are also groups that unfortunately could not withstand the severe damages depression cause on them, some live with it, the other are not strong enough and choose the act of committing suicide. I myself had stepped down that path before but I was lucky that I had the support from my families. Knowing that everyone is not that lucky to have their family support them, I immediately asked myself what if there is an app that interacts with the users and is that supportive element. The best thing about it being an app is everyone can gain access to it globally, user-friendly because the program surrounds the chatting style system.</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The features will include a personal chatbox with the motivation chatterbox, where the user mainly interacts with, it will be like any other chatting app the user has experienced before, basic concept of sending and receiving, the choice of words are not limited as the bot will have a built-in function that detects words and keywords inside the user’s message, sending those keywords back to the database and from there choose the suitable branch of the situation and starts to ask questions back to the user to trim down the branch until the bot reaches the most suitable answer for the user, this does not only work for problems solving purposes but also work for normal everyday conversations, the bot will be able to have casual talks to the user if they chooses to approach the bot with that style. Besides that the app will have its own social media page that users can post anything they want and have other users reply anonymously, we tend to share our problems to the person that we have not met before more than the ones that are close to us, by being anonymous it will make the user feel more comfortable sharing. The app will also have a game that helps guide users to a healthier, better lifestyle, taking care of your virtual pets through using in-game currencies that can be obtained from finishing your projects, daily routines, picking up hobbies, and removing bad habits, whenever the user finishes something, they will tick that part off like a checklist and then gain the currencies. The purpose of giving the user the ability to give themselves credit is to not force the user to play the game but more of giving them a more fun and interactive system that helps them commit to change, the level of their pets and the health/stats will reflect back on the user’s journey. As of this moment that is all the features that I can think of, but I hope that as I progress through my course I will slowly get more ideas to innovate it.</p>
		<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
			<p>In order to create this project I would require a big amount of data storage to put in as many responses as possible for the bot to sort out the list. A suitable software that specialize in making chatting apps and software that makes the game that was mentioned on the previous topic. I will be making a list of questions consisting of multiple common problems that people encounter everyday to a large pool of anonymous responders to collect a good amount of answers to put into the bot’s database as well as small motivational quotes from famous people from the past to present that can go along with the bot message to somewhat assist the bot’s message.</p>
		<h2>Skills Required</h2>
			<p>The skills that are required for my project include experience in graphic designs to help make the overall app and the game more alive. Experience in common coding languages that can be used to make the app, psychology knowledge to create suitable question forms for the bot and implementing psychological analysis algorithms into the bot so it can detect what type of message and the core message from the user. I still do not know much about hardwares and what hardware-related things that I need to use in order to create the app, this will be further updated in the future. The chances of finding the skills, software and hardware that is required to make this project do-able is high since this will not be the first app that surrounds chatting with bot systems, there are a lot of apps that already let us talk to a bot so if I can apply the same method with my project and modify it so it works as what I intended it to, it will be done.</p>
		<h2>Outcome</h2>
			<p>If the project is successful, users will now have a partner that they can share their happy, sad moments with, a forum that shows the user that they are not the only ones that are struggling in life, by interacting with others they will form a stronger bond and ultimately make humans closer together, by playing the pet game the user will be motivated to follow a healthy schedule that will improve their life. The suicidal rate will decrease and the amount of people on the earth that suffers from depression will also appear less. Not to mention it is cheaper than going to see a psychiatrist, for those that do not have enough wealth to be able to seek help.</p>
